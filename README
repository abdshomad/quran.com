This is source code for quran.com beta development. Some components (such as
database dump, fonts, config files) are missing for security or because they
are too big or not appropriate for repository storage. PostgreSQL uses custom
modules. If you need help installing because you're not familiar with Perl or
don't have experience using CPAN to install dependencies, this is not for you.
If you need help installing or require missing components such as the database
or fonts, please send an email to nour@quran.com.


This package is open-source. You are free to use it as you like as long as you
return credit in any place appropriate and notify me via email if you branch
or republish the code with any useful features, sharing the new source back
with us so that we can incorporate the best of it back in.

Thank you, wsalam 3alaykum,
